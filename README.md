# Fullscreen Windowed (Borderless) for Minecraft

This mod is a very simple addition to the game that will allow you to make your game run in **borderless windowed** instead of the default **fullscreen** available in Minecraft.  

#### Advantages of borderless windowed versus default fullscreen

- You can just hit Escape and use your other monitors without minimizing the game
- You can alt+tab out of the game more smoothly
- You can have other windows on top of the Minecraft client when it's not active
